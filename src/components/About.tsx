            I'm a self-driven Computer Science undergraduate with a strong passion for full-stack development, data analytics, and user-focused solutions.
            With hands-on experience in technologies like React.js, Firebase, Python, and Power BI, Iâ€™ve built web applications and dashboards that merge functionality with intuitive design.
            From smart travel platforms to real-time face recognition systems, I enjoy solving real-world problems through scalable and accessible digital solutions.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
              My journey began as an eager Computer Science student, where I quickly discovered a passion for full-stack development, data analysis, and building real-world solutions.
              Through projects like facial recognition systems, campus platforms, and interactive dashboards, I've applied my skills to solve meaningful problems using modern tools and technologies.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              From developing accessible travel apps during internships to exploring computer vision and Power BI on my own, I've always been driven by curiosity and impact.
              Outside of code, I enjoy participating in coding competitions, diving into open-source learning, and staying updated on trends in AI and web development.
